          <h2>Edison National Historical Park</h2>
          <article>Located in West Orange, New Jersey, the Thomas Edison National Historical Park is where Edison's home and laboratory were. The location is owned by the National Park Service and protected as a historic landmark. After his first wife died and Edison married Mina Miller, he purchased this home and moved his family. The park includes an estate, Glenmont; the grounds where Edison and his wife once strolled; and the original laboratory buildings where Edison worked.</article>

          <h2>Edison Memorial Fountain</h2>
          <article>Although he was born in Ohio, Edison grew up in Port Huron, Michigan. The town was near Detroit, so it's little wonder that Detroit's Grand Circus Park is home to the Edison Memorial Fountain. The fountain was dedicated on the 50th anniversary of the light bulb. The large, circular fountain, made of limestone, is on the park's west side. Thomas Edison attended the dedication on Oct. 21, 1929. </article>
