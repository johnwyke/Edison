          <h2>First Invention</h2>
          <article>August 12th, 1877 Thomas Edison invents the first voice recorder. He was actually not trying to invent anything when this came about. However, like some of the most amazing and useful inventions it was figured out trying to make something else. This case is no different, Thomas Edison was trying to make improvements to the telegraph transmitter.  This is when he noticed that moving paper though it made noises that sounds like words when it was sped up. He tried using a large needle called a stylus and a tinfoil cylinder to record. The first words ever recorded were “Mary had a little Lamb.” When he presented it to the public no one believed him at first. Once people came around this is when he became known as “the Wizard of Menlo Park.” </article>

          <h2>Last Invention</h2>
          <article>Thomas Edison’s last invention was that of a better storage battery. He began his efforts in the 1890’s, this was just after the car was introduced. This was the time the steam and electric cars were sold in large amounts. The batteries that were being used in the cars where made up of lead acid. This made them very heavy and because of the material the life was not very long. It was not until 1903 when him and his team had finally figured out the best materials for the job. They tested thousands of different materials until they came across potassium hydroxide which reacted to the iron and nickel electrodes making a strong and reliable battery. Unfortunately, shortly after release there was defects with the batteries. He then redesigned the battery and made it more powerful with better performance in 1910 </article>

          <h2>Most Significant</h2>
          <article>A common misconception is that Thomas Edison invented the light bulb. Shockingly this is false, it goes against most people’s thoughts on this. However, not this entire story is false. Thomas Edison did not create the “first” light bulb, but he did invent the first commercially viable one. There were experiments dealing with Light bulbs dating back to 1802. He first began his dedicated research into the light bulb in 1878. He first tried using platinum which was difficult to work with and expensive. He then resorted to a carbon based high resistance filament. This was his first success by having it burn for 13.5 hours. This was in October of 1879. This is the most significant invention of his because his exact design was used well beyond his death and into the 21st century. He paved the way for many advancements in the science community.</article>
