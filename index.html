          <article>Thomas Edison invented many things and some of the most memorable are the Phonograph, Motion Picture, and the Light Bulb. A Phonograph is considered to be his first great invention and one of his favorites. It was a recorder that would allow the user to record a voice and play it back. One of the most ground breaking the entertainment industry was motion picture. He achieved this by simply putting 35 MM celluloid film and ran a continuous string of these through sprockets over a lamp that illuminated the pictures. Lastly, the one invention that he is most known for inventing is the light bulb. However, one common misconception is he did not actually invent the light bulb. He simply improved it dramatically by find a filament that would illuminate with a lower voltage running through it. Thus making them less expensive and have a longer life. </article>
